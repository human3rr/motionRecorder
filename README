Overview:
motionRecorder is a C++ implementation of an algorithm for motion recording using OpenCV with a couple extra goodies.

Features:
Creates timestamped video recording indicating time of creation.
Video contains timestamp that the frame was captured.
Threaded so writing capture frames to disk does not interfere with continious capture.

Dependencies:
OpenCV
Pthreads

How to build:
cd motionRecorder
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
